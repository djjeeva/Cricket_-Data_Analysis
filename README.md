I'm thrilled to share my submission for the Codebasics Cricket Analytics project. The project aimed at assembling the best XI cricket players from various international teams based on their performance in the last T20 World Cup.

#My Journey:

Throughout this project, I encountered various challenges and learned valuable skills:

Data Preparation: 
I focused on preparing and cleaning data using Python, including handling JSON files.

Power BI Magic: With Power BI, I loaded, modeled, and analyzed the data. I performed ETL using Power Query and created new measures with DAX.

Challenges Faced: Implementing a dynamic tooltip to show player performance against opponent teams and providing deeper insights like 50s/100s and best batting/bowling performances.




## Project Highlights

Data Collection: Web Scraping from ESPN Cricinfo website.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas) for data preparation, Power BI for visualization.

Key Challenges: Handling JSON files, implementing dynamic tooltips, and providing in-depth insights
